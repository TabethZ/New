        <strong>Reading books</strong> can help you develop empathy, understand
        different perspectives, and build emotional intelligence. By exposing
        yourself to diverse characters and storylines, you can develop a greater
        understanding of human nature and emotions. This can be
        <em>beneficial</em> in both your personal and professional life.
